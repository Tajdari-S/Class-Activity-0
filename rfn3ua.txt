Uday Kiran, rfn3ua

I am Uday, a first-year Master's student. 

My first exposure to embedded systems was using esp8266 while doing my home automation. 
My second exposure is building a custom keyboard using Elite-C (ATmega32u4) using 
source code from Git Hub. I took a Graduate Computer Architecture course last semester 
and had experience in C/C++, x86 assembly, and Python. 

Though I have professional experience in low-level programming for x86-based 
microprocessors, my experience in embedded is limited. I strongly believe this course 
will provide insight into RTOS and embedded systems in general.
