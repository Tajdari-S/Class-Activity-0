James O'Connell, jgo2nja

I am a third year computer engineer. 
My only experience with embedded systems was the intro course that I took with Delong last semester. The most
advanced project that I have completed is a task scheduler for an LCD display.
I have a basic understanding of operating systems, I've made a boot sector and a kernel before.
Data structures and algorithms are my favorite part of programming, in which my knowledge is the strongest.
My favorite language is C, and I've also written many programs in x86 assembly.

I am excited to get a better understanding of the ARM architecture through this class, 
as I have almost no experience with it. I am also trying to better my understanding of operating systems,
specifically with respect to memory and scheduling. Finally, I am eager to develop strategies for designs of quick
and efficient embedded systems through the projects in this class.
