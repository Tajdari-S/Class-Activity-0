Yue Zhu (hvs6uc)


I am a first-year graduate student in the Master of Engineering program in Electrical Engineering. 

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from ShanghaiTech University in China and have completed coursework in embedded systems design and FPGA-based systems design. 

In addition, I have gained practical experience as a research assistant at ShanghaiTech University, where I worked on software and hardware design projects in battery-free electronics. 

My work got published in the ACM conference Sensys 2022.


MCU / platforms: STM32, Nordic Nrf52832, Arduino, Raspberry Pi
Language: Embedded C, Python

My research interest lies in both software and hardware design of embedded systems, especially in battery-free electronics or energy harvesting systems, and system-level intermittent computing.
Broadly speaking, I am interested in implementing any embedded system that is fun and challenging.

I am looking for learning system designing techniques from this course.
