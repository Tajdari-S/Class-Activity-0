Hello I'm a third year Computer Engineering major. I took EAR I and II(Embedded Computing & Robotics) during Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 respectively. 
I really enjoyed the project based aspect of both of those courses where there was one overarching goal of having a robot that would complete certain 
tasks. In both of those classes I used an msp432 boards and the TI Robotics Systems Learning Kit that came with a couple booster packs and sensors. 
I used C++ for both of those projects. I've also played around a little bit with Arduinos. I haven't taken OS yet, but I am currently taking the ECE 
version of Computer Architecture.

In this class I hope to learn more about embedded systems to gain a deeper understanding of how to design embedded code as well as techniques for doing so. I 
look forward to the hands-on projects!
