I have taken the intro embedded course and Embedded Computing and Robotics 1, both of which used
the MSP432 and embedded C.

My relavent projects are listed below and were written in C++.

I built a computer mouse that used an ESP32 microcontroller and force sensor for input that
provided haptic feedback proportional to how hard a user clicks the mouse for increased
immersion in video games. The mouse also sends text notifications using Twilio if a user clicks too hard
repeatedly to prevent the development of carpal tunnel.

I did a research internship at GMU where I worked on a robotic dog that autonomously located
gas sources using gas sensors and computer vision. A raspberry pi and a Teensy board were used.

I have done multiple projects while learning embedded programming on an Arduino Uno such as a Pedometer.

I like using embedded programming as a tool to help me with projects and tackle issues I care about.
At the end of this course, I hope to be a more capable and knowledgeable embedded programmer.
