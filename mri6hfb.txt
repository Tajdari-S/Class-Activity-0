I am a fourth year CPE student.  I have taken ECR 1 and 2, as well as comp arch.
I am currently taking OS along with this class.  I also took the ECE Capstone, in which
we created an embedded system that played checkers.  I have used C/C++, python, and some
Java.

I am interested in embedded systems and how they are involved with automation.  I also have
a job offer to develop firmware for PLC controllers.  I took this class to help
prepare me for that, as I expect to learn more about multi-threading and RTOS in general,
as it is something that I will use there.
