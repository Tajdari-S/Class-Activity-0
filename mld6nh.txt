I have little embedded programming experience (one project with Arduino controlling a robot).
I took an operating systems class and a computer architecture class.

I am interested in robotics, and I would like to learn more about the unique design choices 
of real time operating systems. I am working on the Cavalier Autonomous Racing team, but my 
work there does not involve embedded programming, so I would like to gain more experience 
with embedded systems design and programming.
